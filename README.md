# PatternStratergy
I am trying to learn patterns. Some times it can be difficult to see how they apply to real world problems.
To to help with this I have produced my own examples of a number of patterns to help me understand the thought process behind each one. 
I have created Project notes for each example explaining my own thoughts on each pattern.
My understanding and implementation of each pattern may not be 100% correct, but we all have to start somewhere.
